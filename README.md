‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	Emotion Detection: Detects dominant emotions from uploaded images or webcam captures.
	‚Ä¢	Color Palette Generator: Generates a color palette that corresponds to the detected emotion (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).

üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

 1.	Clone the Repository:
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-color-palette-generator.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:
 cd emotion-color-palette-generator

 	3.	Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

‚∏ª

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage
	1.	Run the App:
After the dependencies are installed, run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run emotion_palette_app.py

2.	Interact with the App:
	‚Ä¢	You can either upload an image or use your webcam to detect emotions.
	‚Ä¢	Once the emotion is detected, a color palette and a related Spotify playlist will be displayed.

üîß How it Works
	1.	Emotion Detection:
	‚Ä¢	The app uses the DeepFace library to analyze the uploaded image or webcam snapshot and detect the dominant emotion (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).
	2.	Color Palette Generation:
	‚Ä¢	Based on the detected emotion, a color palette is generated using predefined colors mapped to each emotion. The app uses Matplotlib to create and display the palette.
	3.	Spotify Playlist Suggestions:
	‚Ä¢	A Spotify playlist related to the detected emotion is displayed as a link. Clicking the link opens a playlist curated for that mood.
	4.	Real-Time Emotion Detection (Webcam Mode):
	‚Ä¢	When using the webcam, the app takes a single snapshot and performs emotion detection on that image, showing the result immediately.
