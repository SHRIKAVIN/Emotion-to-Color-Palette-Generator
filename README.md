‚ú® Features

Emotion Detection: Detects dominant emotions from uploaded images or webcam captures.
Color Palette Generator: Generates a color palette that corresponds to the detected emotion (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).
Spotify Playlist Suggestions: Provides a Spotify playlist link based on the detected emotion.
No Continuous Loop: Captures a single image from the webcam without looping, making it simpler to use.


üõ†Ô∏è Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-color-palette-generator.git


Navigate to the project directory:
cd emotion-color-palette-generator


Install Dependencies:Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt




üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

Run the App:After the dependencies are installed, run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run emotion_palette_app.py


Interact with the App:

You can either upload an image or use your webcam to detect emotions.
Once the emotion is detected, a color palette and a related Spotify playlist will be displayed.




üîß How it Works

Emotion Detection:

The app uses the DeepFace library to analyze the uploaded image or webcam snapshot and detect the dominant emotion (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).


Color Palette Generation:

Based on the detected emotion, a color palette is generated using predefined colors mapped to each emotion. The app uses Matplotlib to create and display the palette.


Spotify Playlist Suggestions:

A Spotify playlist related to the detected emotion is displayed as a link. Clicking the link opens a playlist curated for that mood.


Real-Time Emotion Detection (Webcam Mode):

When using the webcam, the app takes a single snapshot and performs emotion detection on that image, showing the result immediately.




üíª Technologies Used

Streamlit: Framework for building the interactive web app.
DeepFace: Used for emotion recognition from images.
OpenCV: For webcam handling and image processing.
Matplotlib: For generating and displaying color palettes.
Spotify API: For generating mood-based playlists.
